                    Aropä allows student peer review activities to be mixed in with traditional
                    instructor or tutor marking. This is typically done to alieviate
                    student anxiety in a high-stakes assessment, by reassuring students that
                    the mark for their assignment will be decided by experts as well as (or
                    rather than) their peers. While there is abundant evidence that students
                    are reliable and accurate markers, this type of peer review does offer
                    some additional quality control.

                    <h3>Setup</h3>

                    <p>
                        Enter the names of the instructors or tutors who will be doing the marking
                        on the <span style="font-weight: 500;"><i>Edit Class List</i></span> page. If you wish to do marking yourself, you
                        will need to enter a different user name to your usual instructor account.
                        A common practice is to add the suffix “-marker”; so, I would
                        use “jham005-marker”. This is necessary because Aropä provides a different
                        interface to instructors from markers and students.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Note that you won’t need to enter a password for your marker account.
                        Instead, switch to this account using the Impersonate Other User
                        facility. When you are finished marking, you can switch back to your
                        instructor account by pressing the “revert” button on the top-right of
                        the page.

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        When you have entered the marker names, open <span style="font-weight: 500;"><i>Specify Allocations</i></span>.

                    </p>

                    <ul class="list-decoration list-xmargin">
                        <li class="col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">Select the type of allocations you want, as usual</li>
                        <li class="col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">In the <span style="font-weight: 500;"><i>Markers</i></span> panel, you will see the names of all the markers you
                            entered in the class list. If you have more than one marker you
                            have the choice of sharing the marking between them or having
                            each marker review every submission.</li>
                        <li class="col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">Select or un-select the markers you wish to use for this activity</li>

                    <h3>Calculating grades</h3>

                    <p>
                        Peer review is a powerful means of quickly generating copious amounts
                        of written, formative feedback. However, it can also be used for assigning
                        marks. In Aropä, you can choose whether to use just the marks
                        assigned by tutors, or to use a weighted average of all the tutor and peer
                        marks.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        By default, the <span style="font-weight: 500;"><i>Grade Calculator</i></span> takes a weighted average of all the
                        marks it has available. The calculator has many options, and they are
                        described in detail in another screencast. The <span style="font-weight: 500;"><i>Settings</i></span> tab allows you to
                        select which reviews to include in the grade calculations. You can select:
                        just the (tutor) markers, just the students, or all the reviews. Remember
                        to press the <span style="font-weight: 500;"><i>Recalculate</i></span> button after you change the selection

                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12" style="padding: 0">

                    <p>
                        The steps to setting up a non-peer review are:
                    </p>

                    <ul class="list-decoration list-xmargin">
                        <li class="col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">Enter the names of the markers in the <span style="font-weight: 500;"><i>Edit
                            Class List</i></span> page.</li>
                        <li class="col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">Create the assignment as usual.</li>
                        <li class="col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">Select which markers you want to use,
                            and how they should divide
                            the work.
                        </li>


                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        Tradional tutor marking does not have to be abandoned when moving
                        to peer reviewing. For a high-stakes assignment, students will be
                        reassured to know their work has been checked by an expert. When
                        grades are involved, you have the choice between using just the marks
                        given by tutors, or using the average of tutor and student marks.

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        This dual marking also lets you check the correlation between the
                        two, and decide in an evidence-based way whether there is value in continuing
                        to use your tutors for marking.
