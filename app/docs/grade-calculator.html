                        Peer review is a powerful means of engaging students in critical reflection
                        and in promptly generating copious amounts of personalised written
                        feedback. It can also be used to assign a mark to a piece of student
                        work.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Having students assign marks to each other raises many questions.
                        Do students mark reliably and fairly? We have plenty of evidence to
                        show that they can and do. As instructors know, deciding on a mark is
                        usually the easy part of writing a review.

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The key difference between peer marking and instructor or tutor
                        marking is that peers (usually) each mark several submissions, so every
                        submissions ends up with several marks. Since just one mark is
                        required, these marks need to be averaged; this can be done in a number
                        of ways. There may also be rogue marks, lone voices that disagree
                        wildly from other reviewers.

                    <h3>Overview of grade calculation</h3>

                    <p>
                        A rubric can contain groups of radio buttons, and the reviewer can select
                        one radio button in each group. Each button has an associated mark.
                        You can specify the marks in <span style="font-weight: 500;"><i>Label Rubric</i></span>, or just use the default marks
                        (1 for the first button in the group, 2 for the second, etc.)

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The marks for the selected buttons are used in <span style="font-weight: 500;"><i>Calculate Grades</i></span>, which
                        does all the calculations needed in averaging the marks from the reviewers.

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Aropä calculates an overall mark for a student’s submission as follows:

                    </p>

                    <ul class="list-decoration list-xmargin">
                        <li class="col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">for each student submission, the marks for each button group are
                            collected (one from each reviewer) and a weighted average is calculated.
                            Weights will be explained shortly;
                        </li>
                        <li class="col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">the total mark for the submission is the sum of these weighted
                            averages;</li>
                        <li class="col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12">only reviewers who have entered a mark are included in the averaging.</li>


                    </ul>


                </div>


                <div class="col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12" style="padding: 0">
                    <hr />
                </div>

                <div class="font-normal col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12" style="padding: 0">
                    <h3>Three ways of averaging</h3>

                    <p>
                        The most common way averaging a collection of marks is to take the
                        mean. For example, if three reviewers give marks of 4, 3 and 1 then the
                        mean is (4 + 3 + 1)/3, or 2.67.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        An alternatively method, which places less emphasis on extreme scores,
                        is the median (middle) mark. With the same marks as above, the median
                        is 3, slightly higher than the 2.67 given by the mean. This reflects the
                        fact that two of the three reviewers gave considerably higher marks than
                        the third

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Lastly, provided there are many more reviews than possible marks,
                        taking the most popular mark (mode) may be a reasonable alternative.
                        Extreme marks are effectively ignored altogether using this method. For
                        example, if reviewers gave marks of 4, 3, 4, 4, 1 then the mode will be
                        exactly 4.

                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12" style="padding: 0">

                </div>

                <div class="font-normal col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12" style="padding: 0">
                    <h3>Identifying and removing outliers</h3>

                    <p>
                        The grade summary page shows the total mark, number of reviews, and
                        “discrepancy” for each author. Technically, discrepancy is the “mean
                        absolute deviation”. This has a straight-forward interpretation of how
                        much, on average, the reviewers disagreed each other.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Clicking on any column heading will sort (or reverse sort) on that
                        column. Sorting on the discrepancy is a quick way of identifying sources
                        of disagreement.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Clicking on the author name will show the marks from all of the
                        reviewers. Clicking further on the name of a reviewer will show details
                        of all the reviews written by that reviewer, along with the average mark.
                        You can see what was written by the reviewer by clicking on the <span style="font-weight: 500;"><i>Extent of
                        commenting</i></span> number. If any reviews look to be seriously out of line, you
                        can exclude them by selecting the checkbox and clicking on <span style="font-weight: 500;"><i>Recalculate
                        grades</i></span>.

                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="col-lg-12 col-md-12 col-sm-12 col-xs-12" style="padding: 0">

                    <h3>Auto-calibration</h3>

                    <p>
                        Reviewers whose marks are generally in line with those given by other
                        reviewers are probably accurate and careful reviewers. Unusual marks
                        often arise when a reviewer is less accurate and careful. Aropä can take
                        this tendency into account in calculating grades. For example, assume
                        reviewer A is twice as “accurate” as reviewer B. If A gives a mark of 4
                        and B gives a mark of 2, then the weighted average will give twice the
                        weight to A’s mark as to B’s; i.e. (2 × 4 + 1 × 2)/(2 + 1) = 10/3 = 3.33,
                        slightly more than the 3 for an equally weighted average.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Auto-calibration can be useful when each submission has at least
                        four (and preferably many more) reviews. It has the effect of identifying
                        and reducing the influence of persistently inaccurate reviewers.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The good things about it are: (a) it is automatic; and (b) it assigns a
                        number to each reviewer. The auto-calibration weights can be used to
                        give students a mark for the consistency of their reviewing, in addition
                        to the quality of their submitted work.

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The weaknesses are that it requires many reviews per submission,
                        and the weights (and consequently marks) are difficult to explain to
                        students.
