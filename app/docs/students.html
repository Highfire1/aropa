                    You may never have written a review of a fellow student's work before - don't worry: your instructor
                    will have prepared a review form for you to fill in when you write your reviews. A link to this
                    will appear after you download the allocated essay (or report, etc.). The form will tell you which
                    specific or general areas to comment on, and may also include some radio buttons you can click on.

                    <h3>Why do I need to do this?</h3>

                    <p>
                        Peer review is good for you in several ways. First, you get to read a selection of material
                        written by other students studying in the same class. There will usually be some who are
                        better and some who are worse than you. Reading their work will tell give you an idea about
                        how you compare, and whether you need to put more work into the course.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        While reviewing, you'll come across a range of approaches to the assignment. Some better, some
                        worse, and some just different. You may learn new ways of approaching the topic, and notice
                        problems and misunderstandings to avoid!

                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Going through the process of marking helps you to understand better what your lecturer expects
                        of you in the assignment. You will start to earn better marks as you get a better idea of what is
                        wanted in the assessment.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Peer reviewing trains you to make judgements on someone else's work. Is it good, or bad? Are
                        there mistakes? How could it be improved? With practice, you will soon start to think about
                        mistakes you make with your own work, and how to recognise and correct them. This is a key
                        skill, one that will stay with you throughout your life.
                    </p>
